# FaceDancer
Part of a series of almost interesting things I codded in notepad just to torture myself. It assumes you are using a default sized command prompt window(80 chars).
A dancing face. In command prompt. It has a lot of bugs but should work at least for a little bit.
When run an ascii face should appear in your command prompt, along with a set of keys which correspond to dance moves. You can tell the face to 
do more than one move at once, just press each move you want it to do in one go, then press enter. You can do this as
many times as you like. When done, press done. The face should now dance. It's pretty buggy, if it starts to go offscreen it will crash,
and winking is pretty messy. Maybe I will fix it someday.
